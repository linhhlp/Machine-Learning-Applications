    "Natural language processing (NLP) has been used widely for a very long time ago. However, recently with the high development of Machine Learning, NLP becomes one of the most important tasks in the industry and is used by many giant companies including Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. These companies have dedicated teams researching and developing state-of-the-art algorithms and models. Recently, OpenAI gathers a lot of attention by providing their ChatGPT and API for developers. These enhancements show a fast pace picture of NLP industries and the bright future of NLP.\n",
