# Recommendation systems: Amazon Products and Reviews

Welcome to my project about popular tools to ease the process of imputing data. Data Imputation is very important in Machine Learning. It helps reserve data and makes more meaningful out of missing data. The work demonstrates the case of a recommendation system with damaged databases.

Nowadays, recommendation systems are one of the most important keys for the success of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and other online retailers, because:

1. It recommends the user find the right product.

2. It recommends the users to other interesting products which can increase the user's engagement. For example, there are 40% more clicks on Google News due to recommendations.

3. It helps the item providers to deliver the items to the right user. On Amazon, 35 % of products get sold due to recommendations.

4. It recommends the users based on their liking to make the content more personalized. On Netflix, most of the rented movies are from recommendations.
