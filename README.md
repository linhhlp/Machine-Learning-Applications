Applications in Machine Learning
=================================

1. [Electrical Conductivity Nanocomposite](Electrical-Conductivity-Nanocomposite)

Utilized TensorFlow.Keras and fine-tuned models using optimization algorithms including Adam, SGD to predict electrical conductivity of nanomaterials with APLE Error below 10%.

2. [Store Sales Time-Series Forecasting](Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting-Kaggle)

Predicted store retailers' sales (Time Series Forecasting) using Linear Regression and Hybrid Model with XGBoost. Analyzed seasonality, trend, and correlation.

3. [Recommendation System based on Amazon Review](Recommendation-System-Amazon-Review)

Built Recommenders and tuned predictors with the memory-based k-NN algorithm, Matrix Factorization-based algorithms, and layered/funnel-based models. A context model was constructed with TensorFlow Recommenders.

4. [Natural Language Processing](Natural-Language-Processing-Machine-Learning)

Demonstrated seq2seq framework in TensorFlow using LSTM neural networks for both encoder and decoder to build Vietnamese Translator. Presented usages of APIs provided by OpenAI (ChatGPT 3) and Cohere AI.

5. [Convert Text to Vector](Text-2-Vect-Vector-Search)

How to convert text to a vector and do semantic search on Cassandra. The study case is to find movies based on the plots by a query of text.
