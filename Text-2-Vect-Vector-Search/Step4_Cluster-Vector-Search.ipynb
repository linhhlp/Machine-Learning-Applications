    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In the previous Chapters, we search for a movie based on a unique query, equivalent to only one vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases of multiple queries, how do we optimize the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the user wants to search for a movie based on a list of movies that they watched in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of recommenders, what we can recommend to a user after he has watched a few items/movies/products recently?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a client viewed a couple of products, we want to suggest some products similar to what he viewed in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approaches A.** Find a center point for all vectors of past queries. This point is the closest to all vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approaches B.** How about the cases where the points scatter? For example, a user watched a comedy and then watched a thriller. A user viewed an electric toothbrush and then viewed a garden chair. These items were in different categories. In this case, we need to cluster them and find the recommendations for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can mix two approaches and rank them based on their distance (similarity) to the history."
