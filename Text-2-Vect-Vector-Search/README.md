# Convert Text to Vector and do searching with Vector Search, DataStax

1. Convert movies' plots to vectors of numbers. Then store them in Cassandra which is provided by DataStax.

2. Do semantic search for an input query with Vector Search by DataStax. This will return movies that plots are close to the query.

A demo is deployed at https://find-movies.com/
